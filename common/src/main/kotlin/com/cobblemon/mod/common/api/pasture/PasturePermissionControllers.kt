 * to the rules of [PrioritizedList]s, and the first non-null [PasturePermissions] returned
 * for a given player and pasture block entity will be used.
 *
 * The fallback of [PasturePermissionControllers.permit] will return permissions that allow
 * the player to pasture their own Pokémon, unpasture others', and will have as many slots
 * to pasture Pokémon as slots exist on the block entity.
