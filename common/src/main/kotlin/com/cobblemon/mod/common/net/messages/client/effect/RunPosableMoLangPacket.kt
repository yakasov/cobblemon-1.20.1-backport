/**
 * Packet sent to run some MoLang in the MoLang environment associated with the given
 * entity (which we're assuming is a posable entity).
 *
 * The expressions are given as strings instead of Expressions because if we make it
 * Expressions and you constructed it from code instead of string parsing then it won't
 * encode-decode properly, and you'll report a bug. Reason why that is: only way to
 * serialize an Expression is to use the originalString property it was parsed from,
 * so if you didn't parse from string that'll be blank and meaningless.
