/**
 * A piece of state that can be added to some species of Pokémon. Registering an implementing class
 * using [SpeciesFeatures.register] adds it as a usable value in the [SpeciesFeatures] list. All Pokémon
 * are given the opportunity to be assigned features depending on whether it's a global feature or they
 * have opted into it in their species JSON.
 *
 * The role of this is to allow species-specific data to be attached to individual Pokémon, such as an alolan
 * flag or a Vivillon pattern variety. This is powerful when combined with [AspectProvider]s.
