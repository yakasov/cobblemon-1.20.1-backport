 * An event fired when a [PokemonEntity] is being loaded from NBT. This could be from sending a Pokémon

 * any changes that are relevant to the entity.
 *
 * Cancelling this event will dispose of the Pokémon after it loads. Use this when the existence of this
 * entity is no longer appropriate, such as if it was an event Pokémon that has expired.
 *
 * @property pokemonEntity The entity being loaded from NBT. All other native loading has been done by this time.
 * @property nbt The NBT the entity is being loaded from.
