  "cobblemon.species.blastoise.desc": "The cannon-like structures on this Pokémon’s shell are composed of specialized bones that can shoot powerful jets of water.

When the weather gets cold, Ekans gather underground to conserve heat and group together into a ball that can consist of hundreds of individuals. When the time comes for them to exit their burrow though, escaping can be a challenge, as it is not uncommon for these Pokémon to find themselves tied together.",
  "cobblemon.species.arbok.name": "Arbok",
  "cobblemon.species.arbok.desc": "A deadly predator found in warm, dry areas, Arbok terrifies its prey with the pattern on its chest before constricting them.

One particularly frightening pattern is found in Arbok who make their homes within the wastes of the Nether, where a consistent source of warmth allows them to move with exceptional speed and precision.",
  "cobblemon.species.pikachu.name": "Pikachu",
  "cobblemon.species.pikachu.desc": "Pikachu’s adorable appearance attracts many admirers, but its unpredictable temper makes it less suited for beginning trainers. When startled or annoyed, Pikachu instinctively discharges electricity from the specialized organs in its cheeks. Even trained Pikachu can react this way, so caution is advised. When large groups of Pikachu gather, the collective electric charge in the air is strong enough to create thunderstorms.",
  "cobblemon.species.pikachu-alola.desc": "Living on warm, sandy waterfronts seems to have mellowed this Pikachu’s behavior. Unlike its forest relatives, this variant is much more laid-back, spending much of its time basking in the sun. However, if a trainer happens upon one resting on the beach, caution is still advised; its electric abilities are no less powerful.",
  "cobblemon.species.raichu.name": "Raichu",
  "cobblemon.species.raichu.desc": "Raichu’s electrical abilities become much stronger upon evolution, but it often struggles to regulate this increased power. When too much electricity builds up, Raichu may become stressed, causing it to act violently and unpredictably. To relieve this pressure, it sinks its tail into the ground to safely discharge excess energy. Many trainers avoid evolving their Pikachu due to Raichu’s reputation, but those that do learn to understand its need for regular energy release.",
  "cobblemon.species.raichu-alola.desc": "This Raichu form uses its newfound psychic abilities to regulate its electric charge, resulting in a calm and relaxed temperament. The origin of its psychic powers remains a mystery, but it uses them to balance on its tail and levitate.

  "cobblemon.species.vulpix.desc": "Vulpix can often doze off for hours, but they become irate whenever someone interrupts their slumber. When angered, Vulpix will throw tantrums, spewing volleys of harmless wispy fireballs from their mouth and nose.",
  "cobblemon.species.vulpix-alola.desc": "Sometimes called Keokeo, these highly sociable variants of Vulpix form into groups and make their dens inside powder snow. However, don't tread too close to these packs, as there is always a Ninetales nearby, ready to freeze any threat to the bone.",

  "cobblemon.species.oddish.desc": "Oddish buries itself in the ground during the day to photosynthesize, storing up energy to wander around at night and spread its seeds.

  "cobblemon.species.gloom.desc": "Gloom's bulbous flower emits a repugnant scent that, according to rumor, can induce temporary memory loss if you stray too close.

  "cobblemon.species.paras.name": "Paras",
  "cobblemon.species.paras.desc": "Paras are typically born aboveground, with no signs of fungal growth on their back. However, as they age, the parasitic mushrooms grow and compel them to bury through the roots of azalea trees, soon finding themselves in the damp, lush caves beneath. This perfect environment allows both the mushroom and the bug to thrive, sometimes a little too much.",
  "cobblemon.species.parasect.name": "Parasect",
  "cobblemon.species.parasect.desc": "It prefers the dim, damp environment of lush caves, often times nestling itself in clay and moss, remaining still for days at a time. This allows the mushroom to conserve and consume the host's energy, causing it to become monstrous in size. As the mushroom grows larger, the host's nervous networks are slowly replaced with webs of neuroreceptive hyphae.",
  "cobblemon.species.venonat.name": "Venonat",
  "cobblemon.species.venonat.desc": "Venonat's body is coated in thin, stiff hairs, which in turn are coated in mild toxins. These toxins only cause slight irritation in humans and other larger creatures, but are deadly to the small insects Venonat preys upon. Its striking resemblance to Butterfree has caused some researchers to attempt to find a connection, but aside from the two both being Bug-type, there seems to be no evidence for this theory.",

  "cobblemon.species.venomoth.desc": "The wings of this nocturnal Pokémon consist of hundreds of thousands of miniscule scales, which fall off like dust every time Venomoth flaps its wings.

  "cobblemon.species.mankey.desc": "Mankey is easily provoked and shows no signs of hesitation when attacking other Pokémon. The rest of its troop is highly influenceable, becoming furious as soon as they notice the rage of one of their members. It seems that anger is one of the only few hormonal responses it has, no matter what the situation is. As a result, it can't help but spend most of the day angry at everything around it.",
  "cobblemon.species.primeape.name": "Primeape",
  "cobblemon.species.primeape.desc": "Primeape spends most of its daily life in a constant state of simmering anger. When riled up, its anger will boil over; blood circulation increases, adrenaline spikes, and intelligence drops to the floor. This behavior is often exploited by other Pokémon, as Primeape becomes very easy to trick. This puts its life in peril as it becomes careless about its surroundings and actions. It doesn't feel any pain while enraged, so it often runs the risk of putting its body through levels of stress that it cannot handle.",
  "cobblemon.species.growlithe.name": "Growlithe",
  "cobblemon.species.growlithe.desc": "They patrol their territory in pairs. I believe the igneous rock components in the fur of this species are the result of volcanic activity in its habitat.",

  "cobblemon.species.bellsprout.desc": "A diurnal plant-like Pokémon that inhabits humid environments where water and sunlight are plentiful.

  "cobblemon.species.weepinbell.name": "Weepinbell",
  "cobblemon.species.weepinbell.desc": "Weepinbell hooks itself to tree branches, waiting to douse unaware prey in poisonous powder before dissolving them in its acid. It is ill advised to traverse forests with known Weepinbell populations at night, as it is known to stir in its sleep and may fall from the branch it had hooked itself onto the day before. If it awakes to see a threat, it will quickly dice them up with its razor sharp leaves.",

  "cobblemon.species.victreebel.desc": "By releasing fragrant scents and flicking about its large, vine-like appendage, Victreebel attracts its Bug-type prey, which it swallows whole.

  "cobblemon.species.tentacool.name": "Tentacool",
  "cobblemon.species.tentacool.desc": "Tentacool is not a particularly good swimmer; most of its movement comes from drifting on the waves. Anyone who mistakes it for an easy target is likely to regret it after being stabbed and pumped full of stinging poison. Its hostility makes it difficult to study, leading researchers to rely on analyzing the dried up remains that wash ashore on new moons.",
  "cobblemon.species.tentacruel.name": "Tentacruel",
  "cobblemon.species.tentacruel.desc": "Its large size prevents Tentacruel from using its old strategy of appearing harmless, so it opts for a more aggressive approach. It engulfs its prey with its tentacles, suffocating them with its lethal poison. While it mostly hunts alone, it's not uncommon to see groups of Tentacruel communicating through intermittent glows from the red orbs on their heads. Unfortunately for some divers, witnessing this behavior can lead to the mistaken belief that the specimens are hunting fish, only to discover that they themselves are on the menu.",

  "cobblemon.species.slowpoke.name": "Slowpoke",
  "cobblemon.species.slowpoke.desc": "This Pokémon’s slow metabolism makes its tail nearly insensitive, allowing bites or detachment to go unnoticed for hours—or even days. The taste is apparently irresistible, attracting frequent nibbles from wild Pokémon. Slowpoke can use its tail as bait to lure fish, but it often lacks the energy or motivation to follow through, preferring to simply relax. While some see Slowpoke as ‘dull,’ others admire its ability to live carefree.",
  "cobblemon.species.slowbro.name": "Slowbro",
  "cobblemon.species.slowbro.desc": "When a Slowpoke's tail is bitten by a Shellder, it evolves into Slowbro, gaining a spiral shell that forms a lifelong bond with its host. This shell absorbs leftovers from Slowbro’s meals and secretes a rare toxin that, in small doses, acts as a tranquilizer, leaving Slowbro serenely calm and lost in deep thought. Though its stillness may appear foolish, Slowbro is often contemplating the virtues of this fleeting journey we call life, gazing peacefully at the sea on the horizon.",
  "cobblemon.species.magnemite.name": "Magnemite",
  "cobblemon.species.magnemite.desc": "A bizarre Pokémon with but a single eye embedded in an iron sphere. I suspect this creature levitates due to the magnetism it emits from its arms, which resemble horseshoe-shaped magnets.",

When it spots prey underwater, it moves with impressive speed to catch it, shaking the prey violently until it loses consciousness.

  "cobblemon.species.dewgong.name": "Dewgong",
  "cobblemon.species.dewgong.desc": "Dewgong has fully adapted to the glacial biomes it inhabits, featuring a pure white coat that camouflages it in snow, an omnivorous diet including seagrass and seabed scraps, and an increase in blubber to protect against freezing temperatures. However, this adaptation has made it vulnerable outside its native environment, as it struggles to survive in warmer or human-inhabited climates. Some towns have even enacted laws prohibiting anyone from touching Dewgong in an effort to protect the species.",

  "cobblemon.species.shellder.name": "Shellder",
  "cobblemon.species.shellder.desc": "Shellder’s unique underwater movement is a fascinating sight for divers. It propels itself backward by rhythmically opening and closing its shell, using its internal muscles to swim at surprising speeds. Often, it travels long distances in search of the perfect spot on the seabed to dig a cozy burrow and settle in for rest. However, Shellder is easily sidetracked from its original goal, especially if it spots something tasty on the surface of the waves.",
  "cobblemon.species.cloyster.name": "Cloyster",
  "cobblemon.species.cloyster.desc": "Cloyster's adaptation to colder waters has strengthened its shell, forming a layer of armor that is nearly impenetrable when fully closed. Over time, impacts on its surface stimulate the growth of icy, pointed spikes, which can either be used to defend against persistent threats or launched like spears at fleeing prey. Remarkably, even when it can't see, Cloyster demonstrates exceptional aim, rarely missing its mark.",

They use these same extrasensory powers to ward off predators.",
  "cobblemon.species.exeggcute-alola.desc": "A different breed of Exeggcute with a thicker set of outer shells to better defend against Crabrawler, this breed's main predator. They intake rainwater through the openings on their heads, which they can store and use for months at a time in case their habitat should ever pass through a prolonged period of drought.",
  "cobblemon.species.exeggutor.name": "Exeggutor",
  "cobblemon.species.exeggutor.desc": "Colloquially referred to as \"The Walking Jungle\", this Pokémon's three heads think independently. Though they never seem to squabble, Exeggutor often has trouble getting about from place to place when they can't decide on a single direction that they want to move in. When their brains are in sync, however, Exeggutor's combined psychic power can be devastating for any opponent to deal with.",
  "cobblemon.species.exeggutor-alola.desc": "Exeggutor are known to grow at vastly different rates depending on the amount of sunlight they get.

Despite their bulk, the vines are very brittle and break easily, but this allows it to escape should its vines get caught on anything.

  "cobblemon.species.kangaskhan.name": "Kangaskhan",
  "cobblemon.species.kangaskhan.desc": "Powerfully built and covered in thick armored plating, Kangaskhan is a force to be reckoned with, especially when protecting its young.

  "cobblemon.species.horsea.name": "Horsea",
  "cobblemon.species.horsea.desc": "Horsea has poor endurance and is only capable of swimming in short bursts, so it clings to bits of kelp or coral to keep itself from being swept away by the current.

When they reach these calm waters, the male uses its beautiful fins in courtship dances, and the horn on its head to bore out nests in the riverbed. Researchers are fiercely divisive on whether the horns or the fins are what attract a female Seaking.",
  "cobblemon.species.staryu.name": "Staryu",

These strange Pokémon possess impressive regenerative abilities, capable of growing back entire limbs if they are torn off in battle.

  "cobblemon.species.ditto.name": "Ditto",
  "cobblemon.species.ditto.desc": "A peculiar species, Ditto are capable of rapidly reconstituting their body structure to mimic that of anything they can see. Studies conclude that certain specimens excel in specific aspects of transformation, while others fall short in some areas, as every Ditto is unique in their own way.

  "cobblemon.species.pichu.name": "Pichu",
  "cobblemon.species.pichu.desc": "While Pichu are in possession of impressive electrical power, they have yet to learn how to control it and tend to shock themselves as much as their opponents.

Researchers believe this is an attempt to gain more mastery over their abilities.",

  "cobblemon.species.natu.name": "Natu",
  "cobblemon.species.natu.desc": "Natu's wings aren't yet developed enough for it to fly, so it wanders under trees where other Pokémon live, hoping that their movement will cause fruit to fall for it to eat.

Anything that locks eyes with Natu is overcome with an intense feeling of dread and anxiety, often causing them to flee.",

  "cobblemon.species.xatu.desc": "Aside from its eyes restlessly following the sun, Xatu stands motionless for most of the day. Some \"theorists\" postulate that this activity is what gives Xatu its precognition.

  "cobblemon.species.flaaffy.desc": "Flaaffy's skin has grown thick and rubbery to insulate it from its own electrical discharge. Its wool is much more sparse than that of Mareep, but the static electricity it builds up is much more powerful, making it dangerous to handle.

  "cobblemon.species.ampharos.name": "Ampharos",
  "cobblemon.species.ampharos.desc": "Ampharos has lost the ability to grow wool, and its potent electricity is now stored throughout its body. This causes the light on its tail to be incredibly bright, and it is oftentimes used as a beacon to guide ships to shore. Thankfully, Ampharos has much more control over its power now, but touching the orb at the end of its tail is still discouraged, as the discharge can easily knock even a grown Copperajah off its feet.",

  "cobblemon.species.sudowoodo.desc": "A cunning Pokémon that mimics a tree, despite being comprised of a more rock-like substance. Due to its Rock-typing, this behavior is theorized to exist to dissuade Water-types and lure in Bug-types for advantageous battles. The only flaw in Sudowoodo's master plan is its weakness to water. If any generous trainer approaches it with a watering can in hand, it will immediately abandon its masquerade and flee.",
  "cobblemon.species.politoed.name": "Politoed",

With this versatile tool at its disposal, its real hands are rarely used, and they end up serving more as a temporary replacement just in case its tail needs time to recover from an injury.",
  "cobblemon.species.sunkern.name": "Sunkern",
  "cobblemon.species.sunkern.desc": "Sunkern subsists on morning dewdrops that form on low-lying foliage. To conserve energy until its evolution, it moves very little and relies on a unique defense: if threatened, this fragile Pokémon will shake violently in hopes of scaring off attackers. Its bright, summery yellow hue is thought to be the origin of an old wives' tale, claiming that newborn Sunkern fall from the sky like drops of sunshine.",
  "cobblemon.species.sunflora.name": "Sunflora",
  "cobblemon.species.sunflora.desc": "Like many Grass-type Pokémon, Sunflora generates energy through photosynthesis, converting sunlight into nutrients. Throughout the day, it energetically rushes from place to place, fanning its petals and leaves in hopes to absorb as much sunlight as possible.

  "cobblemon.species.slowking.desc": "Slowking receives a stimulant injected directly into its brain by the Shellder clamped onto its head, resulting in a remarkable boost in intellect and intuition. Some Slowbro even gather to follow it as servants, drawn by its cool confidence and strategic wisdom in difficult situations. The only thing that disrupts its composure is losing an intellectual challenge—a rare occurrence, of course.",

  "cobblemon.species.misdreavus.desc": "Misdreavus loves to frighten children by releasing blood-curdling shrieks and sobs into the dead of night, feasting on the fear it creates by doing so.

  "cobblemon.species.qwilfish-hisui.desc": "Living in colder waters seems to have caused Qwilfish to undergo biological changes. It collects poison from the food it eats and pumps it all into its thick venomous spines for later use.
